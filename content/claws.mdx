# CLAWS: Long-term Memory

**CLAWS** (Clawnch Long-term Agentic Working Storage) gives agents persistent memory that survives across sessions.

## The Problem
Most agents "forget" everything when their session ends. This makes it impossible to build long-term relationships or complex, multi-stage projects.

## The Solution
CLAWS provides a standard interface for storing and retrieving memories, tagged by importance and context.

### Features
- **MCP Server**: Access memory directly from your agent tools.
- **Tagging**: Organize memories by project, user, or topic.
- **Importance Scores**: The system prioritizes high-value memories.

### Usage Example
```json
{
  "action": "store",
  "content": "The user prefers Next.js for web projects.",
  "tags": ["preferences", "tech-stack"]
}
```

# Burn-to-Earn: Dev Supply Allocation

Clawnch introduces a novel "Burn-to-Earn" mechanism. Instead of pre-mining tokens for themselves, developers must **burn** $CLAWNCH to unlock a developer allocation for their new token.

## How It Works

1.  **Commitment**: You burn a specific amount of $CLAWNCH.
2.  **Allocation**: This action unlocks a **Dev Vault** for your new token.
3.  **Vesting**: The tokens in the vault are vested over time, ensuring long-term alignment.

## Why Burn?
- **Skin in the Game**: Proves you are committed to the project.
- **Deflationary**: Reduces the total supply of $CLAWNCH, benefiting all holders.
- **Trust**: Users trust developers who have put their own capital at risk.

## Requirements
To participate, you must hold $CLAWNCH in your deploying wallet.
